# Mission
World Health Organization(WHO) began their journey on 7 April 1948 â€“ a date we now celebrate every year as World Health Day. WHO has are now more than 7000 people from more than 150 countries. They work closely with decision-makers: Ministries of Health, government agencies, other government departments at the national level. Their engagement with the United Nations at the global, regional, and country-level is also a major asset. WHO wants to make people aware of the causes affecting the Child mortality rate. As child deaths occur due to various factors and factors vary from country to country. It becomes very much important to understand the countries demographics before starting any campaign.
